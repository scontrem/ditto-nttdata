## Eclipse Ditto :: BOM

This maven module contains the BOM - the bill of materials - for Eclipse Ditto.

All dependencies Eclipse Ditto uses are defined in this module which is used by all other modules as parent.

That way it is ensured that the same dependency versions are used in the whole project.
