/** A [[akka.event.LoggingAdapter]] with additional functionality.
 *
 * The main purpose of ThreadSafeDittoLoggingAdapter is to provide an API for easily setting a correlation ID
 * or other arbitrary values to the logging
 * <a href="http://logback.qos.ch/manual/mdc.html">Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC)</a> <em>before each log
 * operation</em>.
 * <p>
 * Once a usable correlation ID is set to a ThreadSafeDittoLoggingAdapter it will be appended to the log by
 * all log operations of that logger instance.
 * Usable means that the correlation ID is neither `null` nor an empty CharSequence.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The following example shows that the correlation ID gets only appended for the info message.
 * The call `logger.withCorrelation(...)` creates a temporary logger instance which includes the specified
 * correlation ID.
 * The warn message uses the original logger without a correlation ID, therefore, the correlation ID gets not appended.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * final ThreadSafeDittoLoggingAdapter logger = DittoLoggerFactory.getThreadSafeLoggingAdapter(MyClass.class);
 *  logger.withCorrelationId("my-correlation-id").info("This is a normal SLF4J log operation with correlation ID in MDC.");
 *  logger.warn("The correlation ID is appended no more.");
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The second example shows how to use the same correlation ID for several log operations without the need to call
 * `withCorrelationId(...)` before each.
 * A call of [[ThreadSafeDittoLoggingAdapter discardCorrelationId()]] discards the correlation ID eventually.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * ThreadSafeDittoLoggingAdapter logger = DittoLoggerFactory.getThreadSafeLoggingAdapter(MyClass.class); // note that the variable is not final
 * logger = logger.withCorrelationId("my-correlationId"); // assigns a new logger instance to "logger" variable.
 *  logger.info("This message has the appended correlation ID.");
 *  logger.info("So does this message.");
 *  logger.info("And this.");
 * logger = logger.discardCorrelationId(); // assigns a new logger instance without correlation ID to "logger" variable.
 *  logger.warn("The correlation ID is appended no more.");
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Objects of this class are safe to be shared between different threads.
